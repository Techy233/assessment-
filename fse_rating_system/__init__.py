# This file makes Python treat the directory fse_rating_system as a package.

# You can optionally import key classes or functions here to make them
# more easily accessible from the package level, e.g.:
# from .models import FSE, AssessmentChecklist
# from .assessment import perform_assessment, calculate_star_rating
# from .notifications import format_assessment_sms, send_sms

# For now, keeping it empty is fine. Users of the package will import
# specific modules like:
# from fse_rating_system.models import FSE
# from fse_rating_system.assessment import perform_assessment
